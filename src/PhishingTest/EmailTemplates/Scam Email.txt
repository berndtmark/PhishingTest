Hi All,

John mentioned that we're now using a new corporate version of Amazon to manage employee benefits. Would you mind letting me know what you think of it? Your account is already setup so just login with your usual work email and password. Let me know what you think of it asap so that I can pass on your feedback. You can login here.

Cheers,
Padraig

Hi Padraig,

Can you please get everyone to login to the new employee benefits site that I sent to you earlier? I really need to get feedback on this asap. Appreciate your help.

Cheers,
John
